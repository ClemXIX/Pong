# Pong
"The best thing to understand Oriented Object is to create a game"  
R.C today to me  
  
  
  
The pong.py file is a introduction to pygame from this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf3-aDXG8q4

and the pong_oo.py file is myself converting the globals function to a class who is called inside the game loop  

The purpose was to understand what to put in the __init__ class, what to do in the methods, and to initialize the instance before the loop
